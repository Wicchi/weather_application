# weather_application
This is weather application wrote using VITE v3.2.5

The data in this app is fetched using <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/">Open-Meteo API and using <a href="https://openlayers.org/">Open Layers</a> for the map and <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a> for the chart.

As a input for fetch API user must input the longitude and latitude and press the submit button.

Also, the user can decide what type of weather condition they want to plot a forecast.

The time range for the forecast is one month of current time.

Once user press the submit button, the char with forecast will be plotted. Position on the Map (Open Street Map) will be updated by input coordinates. Default position of the map is Czech Republic, Prague. Correct weather condition for the input coordinates will be displayed.
